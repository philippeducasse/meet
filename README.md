# Meet App #

This project will create an app which allows users to access different events by cities. Users will be able to filter through different cities and browse through the events happening there. Users will be able to click on specific events of interest from a list in order to show or hide the details of each event. 

This app will be built using REACT.

Users will be authenticated & authorised using OAuth, in which Google acts as the third party authenticator (users must have a google account to be able to use the app).


## Serverless fucntionality ##

This application uses serverless functionality by accessing a google calendar hosted by CareerFoundry. When a user selects a specific city, this will trigger a serverless function which will fetch data from a cloud server and return it in JSON format. 

## Feature 1: Filter Events by City

** User story ** 

As a user I should be able to filter events by city So that I can see the list of events that take place in that city

Scenarios

Scenario 1: When user hasn't searched for a city, show upcoming events from all cities. Given user hasn’t searched for any city When the user opens the app Then the user should see a list of all upcoming events

Scenario 2: User should see a list of suggestions when they search for a city. Given the main page is open When user starts typing in the city textbox Then the user should see a list of cities (suggestions) that match what they’ve typed

Scenario 3: User can select a city from the suggested list. Given the user was typing “Berlin” in the city textbox And the list of suggested cities is showing When the user selects a city (e.g., “Berlin, Germany”) from the list Then their city should be changed to that city (i.e., “Berlin, Germany”) And the list of suggestions should disappear And the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city.

Feature 2: Show/hide an event's details

Given: user has clicked a city to display the events there and has not specified the number of events to be displayed
When: list of events is displayed

As a user, I should be able to see and search for details by city so that I can use some features of the app even when offline

Scenario 1: Show cached data when there’s no internet connection

Given: The user no longer has access to the internet
When: user opens the app
Then: the app will continue displaying the cached data and an error message will appear

Given: the user no longer has access to the internet
When: user tries to change the search settings by changing the city or the time settings
Then: the app will display an eeror message saying that internet connection is unavailable

Feature 5: Data visualization

As a user, I should be able to visualise the number of upcoming events in a chart so that I can quickly see the number of events by cities
